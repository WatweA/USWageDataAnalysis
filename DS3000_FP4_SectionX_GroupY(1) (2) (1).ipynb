    "Our project decided to tackle understanding how different demographics can affect the personal income of individuals. We believe that there are some data visualizations tackling this issue, but many are highly politicized or hard to interpet. This has led to a lack of understanding on this topic by the general pulic. The topic of our project is determining to what degree an income gap exists and along which demographic borders does it fall. Some of our learning objectives include analyzing the gender-based income gap and the model minority theories. We would also like to analyze which demographic factors are the most significant in influencing one's income.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important problem to tackle, because without an unbiased understanding of the problem, we cannot create well informed public policy. The lack of concrete evidence towards either side of the political divide over this issue creates more misinformation and angst rather than approaching a solution. The insights derived from this project could show where the primary causes of income gaps are. Thus the problem is no longer the “income gap”, rather the problem will more clearly be identified (i.e. If the primary gap found is the lack of X race in Y industry, future studies could examine the cause of that phenomenon). There has been some research done in this area. A report titled Income and Wealth in the United States by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation found that incomes varied considerably between the coasts and the midwest and the south of the United States. Furthermore, income varied based on race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and gender. However, the analysis fozues on the median income levels, and does not produce any correlataional analysis (1). Other projects have looked into how the middle class has shrunk over time in America, but not dived into specifics of demographic data (2). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the aforementioned problem and its importance, we set out to tackle the following questions:\n",
    "* To what degree do factors including gender, race, family wealth, geographic area, and occupational industry influence one's income?\n",
    "* To what extent does the gender-based income gap exist and are there deviations for different wealth brackets, races, or geographic areas?"
